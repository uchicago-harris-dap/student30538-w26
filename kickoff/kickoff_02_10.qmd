## `preprocessing.py` in problem sets {style="font-size: 0.8em"}
- Q: do we need to submit `preprocessing.py` for problem set submissions?
- A: No. PS5 says

    > We encourage you to work mainly in `.py` scripts and then port everything to a `.qmd` submission at the end. 
- Concretely, this means it will be helpful to have a separate `preprocessing.py` script when developing. When you are done with the whole problem set, take that script and include it as a code chunk at the top of the `.qmd`
- Thank you James for raising this question on Ed!

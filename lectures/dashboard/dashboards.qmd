## From A Static Process
![](pictures/process_1.png){ width=70% fig-align="center"}

::: {.notes}
* Review table of contents (does not render as a separate slide)
* When you submit a problem set or read a paper, It usually is imagined to follow a process like this
* Number one you write the code 
* number two you run the code
* number three the recipient looks like at output. 
:::

## To A Dynamic Process
![](pictures/process_2.png){ width=70% fig-align="center"}

::: {.notes}
* Except that  for anyone who has spent time at the Harris School or in another research environment, you know that this is not actually anything like how research happens. 
* In practice after you look at the output, you interact with the output and then you go back and you change the code and you run the code again and you look at the output again. 
:::

## To A Dynamic Process
![](pictures/process_3.png){ width=70% fig-align="center"}

* When you analyze a dataset, your process looks a lot more like the dynamic one than the static one. Dashboards allow someone who does not code to do a limited version of the same process you go through.


::: {.notes}
What dashboards to do is they enable someone who does not write code to do a small scale version of the skill that you already have, which is to manipulate the code and re-examine the output.

::: {.notes}
The other thing dashboard is that they need your code to be run not just on your computer but also run on a personal web server. 
:::

## Other benefits of dashboards 

* There are two other major benefits of dashboards which we will not spend time on in class, but you should also know about 
    * Consolidated information: aggregate data from various sources into one unified interface
    * Real-time data metrics: dynamic view based on automatically-updated data feed 
* *(Impressive: they are a great way to flex your data skills for your portfolio!)*

## Where we are going

[http://uchicago-harris-dap-dashboards-4.streamlit.app/](http://uchicago-harris-dap-dashboards-4.streamlit.app/)


::: {.notes}
Poke around here a bit to clarify that this is what we will be able to do by the end of the lecture note
:::

## Dashboards: Promises and Pitfalls

When Professor Ganong worked in the Mayor's Office in Boston, the mayor asked for every single department to suggest metrics for a dashboard. The mayor put a TV in his office so that the dashboards would be displayed at all times.

Discussion questions: 

1. What are examples of data that a city would benefit from tracking with a dashboard?
2. What are examples of data where putting it on a dashboard might inadvertently lead to poor management or create bad incentives for workers?


::: {.notes}

1.
Clearance rate for reported crimes,
School attendance,
Number of snow plows in operation
Number of overdoses

2. 
Number of closed citizen complaints. Not good because it creates an incentive to close complaints rapidly rather than to make sure that they are actually solved.
Number of miles covered by street sweepers. Not good because it incentivizes covering ground rather than doubling back when something is missed to make sure it is actually cleaned.
Number of cars towed. Not clear if we want this metric to be high or low, depends on the context.

:::

## Streamlit {style="font-size: 0.8em"}

Streamlit’s is designed for data scientists who want to share analyses without needing front-end development skills. Beyond being easy to use, we chose to teach Streamlit for a few reasons:

1. Native to Python, works well with existing Python tools (e.g. Altair)
1. All its features are free (so long as you are making public dashboards)
1. Open source: [https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit)

These lecture slides draw on examples and text from [https://docs.streamlit.io](https://docs.streamlit.io).

Caveat: Streamlit is that it is best for prototyping (not computationally efficient for many users). We will talk more at the end of the lecture about how you will use streamlit and other tools going forward.

::: {.notes}

It is most useful for creating a prototype. If someone decides it is needs to be accessed by many users or needs to be built on top of secure data it will be replicated using a different dashboarding tool. This is very common. When professor Ganong worked at the city of Boston, everything that was going to be used on a continuing basis was transferred to another more stable platform. 

:::


## Introduction: summary

* Dashboards let non-coders interact with data
* Introduce `streamlit`
* Note on process: this is our first year teaching this lecture note so we are highly uncertain how long it will take (both each slide and the lecture overall)

::: {.notes}
Review table of contents for the rest of lecture
:::

# Dashboards as websites


## My first dashboard 

```{python}
#| eval: false
import streamlit as st
st.write("""
# My first app
Hello *world!*
""")
```

In this lecture: `$` means run at the terminal (on Macs the prefix is `%`). You do not need to type `$`.

* `$ pip install streamlit`
* `$ streamlit run 1/hello_world_1.py`

::: {.notes}
Re-review the table of contents

We will start with the most simple possible dashboard. If you want to run this code, you can do just two steps first to install streamlit by running this first line of code at the terminal and then you run the script again at the command line. 

:::

<!-- MS to PG: a roadmap here would be really helpful. PG to MS do you mean for this section or for this lecture as a whole? I already had a speaker note at the very very beginning (on the first slide) saying to review the table of contents. But clearly that wasn't enough. I now added a note which says "re-review the table of contents". But maybe there's something else which doesn't correspond to either of these which would be more helpful? 

MS to GGG: ah, I think I missed that there is supposed to be a table of contents slide that didn't render. Re-reviewing ToC at this point would still be helpful, though!-->


## My first dashboard -- two ways to display
1. **Local** Create a server on your computer. Access from your web browser (and no one else's).
2. **Online** Create a server in the cloud. Access from any web browser.

<!-- MS to GGG: I would add a note on 1 that says something like "this is what you just did on the last slide" -->

## My first dashboard -- putting it online
* Prep -- [https://github.com/uchicago-harris-dap/dashboards](https://github.com/uchicago-harris-dap/dashboards)
    * Create a separate repo just for your dashboards. 
    * Be sure it is public.
    * Push 
<!-- MS to GGG: just tried deploying this and was successful (except 3/Hello.py)
Some notes based on that:
1. add a bullet here that you have to connect your github account to streamlit community cloud if it's your first time deploying something
2. I'd also add a bullet here that you have to run `streamlit run [dashboardname].py` locally to get to the page with the Deploy Now button (unless I'm missing something, I think this is step 3 for deploying?)
3. Discuss live that you deploy someone else's dashboard by cloning their (public) repo onto your own computer, running it locally, and then deploying from there. -->
* Three clicks: Deploy ->  Deploy Now (under Streamlit Community Cloud) -> Deploy (with pre-filled repo, branch, and file names).
* Workflow: Streamlit does **not** actually deploy the script which is stored on your computed. Instead, it reads the script which is pushed to a public repo and deploys that.

[http://uchicago-harris-dap-dashboards-1.streamlit.app/](http://uchicago-harris-dap-dashboards-1.streamlit.app/)

::: {.notes}
Comment for maggie: You might wonder how it is possible that we will be live-deploying the same script multiple times (once every class). The answer is that each time we are just over-writing the existing deployment.
:::


## My second dashboard

* `$ streamlit run 2/hello_world_2_local.py` 
* Uncomment `st.altair_chart(chart_to_show)`. Save. Show detection of file change.
    * Fun fact: streamlit will automatically figure out how to print various data types to the web so you also can instead just write `chart_to_show`. 
* This is the normal workflow for building a streamlit dashboard. Update code. Save. Re-run in browser. Once you are happy, then you deploy.
*  [http://uchicago-harris-dap-dashboards-2.streamlit.app/](http://uchicago-harris-dap-dashboards-2.streamlit.app/)

::: {.notes}
Next I will show slightly more sophisticated script (SCREEN: hello_world_2_local.py)

In this script, I’m going to need the Seattle weather file that you used earlier and visualization and then I’m going to make a chart out of it. 

Point to pandas command.

Point to altair command. 

SCREEN: Slide. Implement the steps described in the slide.

For the rest of this lecture, we aren't going to do any more live deployments (creates unnecessary live debugging) so instead just visit the deployed dashboard on the web.

SCREEN: [http://uchicago-harris-dap-dashboards-2.streamlit.app/](http://uchicago-harris-dap-dashboards-2.streamlit.app/). On that page,  review "manage app", "record a screencast"

# Interactive dashboards

## Roadmap 

Dashboard 3. Multipage. 


Dashboard 4. Uber pickups. "Classic" streamlit dashboard.


## Dashboard 3 roadmap 

1. Homepage with dropdown menu
1. Plotting demo with button
2. Dataframe demo with selection box and table
3. Mapping demo with checkboxes

Preview [http://uchicago-harris-dap-dashboards-3b.streamlit.app/](http://uchicago-harris-dap-dashboards-3b.streamlit.app/)

## Dashboard 3 Homepage Review code {style="font-size: 0.8em"}

* Review `intro()` function
* Dropdown bar created via `st.sidebar.selectbox("Choose a demo", page_names_to_funcs.keys())`

{{< include snippet/multipage.qmd >}}



## Feature: taking input
* Streamlit has a huge number of different ways to take [input](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/widgets). In this lecture you will see
    * `st.button()`
    * `st.checkbox()`
    * `st.slider()`
    * `st.selectbox()`

## Example 3 plotting demo  {style="font-size: 0.8em"}
* Use `st` commands to set up page
* Set up blank `progress_bar`, `status_text`, `chart` (writes Vega-Lite for us)
* Loop to generate random numbers

{{< include snippet/1_📈_Plotting_Demo.qmd >}}

::: {.notes}
In the static visualization lectures we mentioned vega-lite without explaining really how you would use it. Now you can see how it is used which is that Streamlit is going to write Vega-Lite for us 
:::

## DataFrame demo  data preview

```{python}
#| code-fold: true
import pandas as pd
def get_UN_data():
    AWS_BUCKET_URL = "http://streamlit-demo-data.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com"
    df = pd.read_csv(AWS_BUCKET_URL + "/agri.csv.gz")
    return df
```

```{python}
get_UN_data()
```

## DataFrame demo review code {style="font-size: 0.8em"}
* Choose inputs `countries = st.multiselect()`
* Print table using `st.write()`
* `melt` for `chart` 

{{< include snippet/3_📊_DataFrame_Demo.qmd >}}

## Feature:  `st.write()`

*  In this example, `st.write()` is used to make a table (analogous to `print()` or `head()`)
* Useful tip: `st.write()` is Streamlit's "Swiss Army knife". Pass almost anything: latex, Matplotlib figures, Altair charts, multiple arguments, and more. Don't worry, Streamlit will figure it out and render things the right way. Full list [here](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/write-magic/st.write)




## Mapping demo data preview {style="font-size: 0.8em"}

Runs on [`pydeck`](https://deckgl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) ("High-scale spatial rendering"). Makes gorgeous maps (will revisit). In Terminal/command line: `$ pip install pydeck`

| data preview  |

## mapping demo review code

Review `HexagonLayer`, `ScatterplotLayer`, `TextLayer`, `ArcLayer`

{{< include snippet/2_🌍_Mapping_Demo.qmd >}}

## (Optional) Summarize how each dataset is used {style="font-size: 0.8em"}

|  Data preview  | Layer name | notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [bike_rental_stats](http://raw.githubusercontent.com/streamlit/example-data/master/hello/v1/bike_rental_stats.json) | `HexagonLayer`  |  bar height set by number of rental at each lat lon |
| [bart_stop_stats](http://raw.githubusercontent.com/streamlit/example-data/master/hello/v1/bart_stop_stats.json) | `ScatterplotLayer` | radius = `exits`|
| [bart_stop_stats](http://raw.githubusercontent.com/streamlit/example-data/master/hello/v1/bart_stop_stats.json) | `TextLayer`   | `get_text="name"` |
| [bart_path_stats](http://raw.githubusercontent.com/streamlit/example-data/master/hello/v1/bart_path_stats.json) | `ArcLayer` |  arcs via `get_source_position = ["lon", "lat"], get_target_position = ["lon2", "lat2"]` |


::: {.notes}
Not sure we will need to talk about this. only cover it if people are confused from looking at the code itself.

## Uber pickups: a full-fledged dashboard 


[http://uchicago-harris-dap-dashboards-4.streamlit.app/](http://uchicago-harris-dap-dashboards-4.streamlit.app/)

* This is the "classic" Streamlit dashboard (the one they use in all the demos) 
* Why? Pretty, adapts nicely to user input, and it showcases integration with `pydeck` and `altair`.

## Uber pickups: preview data
```{python}
#| code-fold: true
import os
def load_data():
    path = "uber-raw-data-sep14.csv.gz"
    if not os.path.isfile(path):
        path = f"https://github.com/streamlit/demo-uber-nyc-pickups/raw/main/{path}"

    data = pd.read_csv(
        path,
        nrows=6,  
        names=[
            "date/time",
            "lat",
            "lon",
        ],  # specify names directly since they don't change
        skiprows=1,  # don't read header since names specified directly
        usecols=[0, 1, 2],  # doesn't load last column, constant value "B02512"
        parse_dates=[
            "date/time"
        ],  # set as datetime instead of converting after the fact
    )

    return data
```

```{python}
load_data()
```

## Uber pickups review code {style="font-size: 0.7em"}
* User chooses time of day (`pickup_hour`) -- line 115
* Helper function `filterdata(data, hour_selected)` -- line 69
* `map(data, lat, lon, zoom)` makes a PyDeck `HexagonLayer` (line 41). Repeat 4x (lines 140-157).
* `histdata(df, hr)` makes an altair histogram with n rides -- lines 170-182

{{< include snippet/uber_pickups.qmd >}}

::: {.notes}
Discussion question -- Why does `map` need to take lat and lon as an argument?
Answer: this is saying where we should be looking when the map is first created

Show that if you zoom out on the three airports you get back to the exact same underlying dataset, it's just starting in a different place.

:::

<!-- MS to PG: at this point I started to get pretty confused :( I don't understand what st.session_state means. 

I see you define it later under "What is a session"

PG to MS reformatted it to just say pickup hour without mentioning session state -->




## Summary

Saw four dashboards

* Multipage
    * plot
    * data frame
    * map
* Uber pickups -- map + plot

# Demystifying dashboards


## Roadmap
* Why dashboards are different than `.py` (or notebooks or `qmd`)
* Bare vs streamlit mode
* toy example of what streamlit mode can do
* What is a session?


## Why dashboards are different than `.py` {style="font-size: 0.8em"}

The first section of this lecture treated dashboards as websites without user input. This is like a normal Python script. Run once and gives you output.

The second section made dashboards interactive. To do this, it must be the case that the entire dashboard, or some part of it, may be run more than once.

- In Terminal/command line: `$ pip install watchdog`

`watchdog` is the file-watching library Streamlit leans on to detect code/data changes (like when we got the option to "re-run" with dashboard 2)

## Bare mode vs streamlit mode {style="font-size: 0.8em"}

* "Bare mode" (`$ python app.py`) runs your script like standard Python; output is just whatever the script prints. 
* "Streamlit mode" (`$ python -m streamlit run app.py` or for short `$ streamlit run app.py`) does four things:
    * sets up a server to run your script
    * records the state (e.g. the choice in `st.selectbox`)
    * reruns code on state changes (e.g. new choice in in `st.selectbox`)
    * serves the interactive user interface (UI) found in the browser
* There's a lot of extra code under the hood, streamlit's goal is for you to focus on the Python code (and ignore all the running a server, taking user input, designing a nice webpage)


## Simple re-run demo overview {style="font-size: 0.8em"}

[http://uchicago-harris-dap-dashboards-5.streamlit.app/](http://uchicago-harris-dap-dashboards-5.streamlit.app/)

* `$ streamlit run 5/session_state_example.py`
* User chooses `route = st.selectbox("CTA Route", ...)` and `cut_pct = st.slider("What fraction of service to cut?", ...)`
* Computer then runs a computation which takes 3 seconds (on the pset, you will see an example where it takes much longer than 3 seconds)
* Returns a result
* What if we want to run the exact same computation twice? Better to use the saved result!

<!-- MS to GGG: in the session_state_example.py code, I would add "min_value=  0.0, max_value = 50.0, value= 10.0 to line 10 so that students can reference it as an example to work off of for the do-pair-share -->
## Simple re-run demo review code


{{< include snippet/session_state_example.qmd >}}

<!-- MS to GGG: can you add a "roadmap" to reviewing this code, similar to what you had above?  -->
## What is a session? {style="font-size: 0.8em"}

* A session is a single instance of viewing an app. 
* Multiple users = multiple sessions. 
* If the user refreshes their browser page or reloads the URL to the app, their Session State resets and they begin again with a new session.
* Session State provides a dictionary-like interface where you can preserve info between script reruns. Use `st.session_state` with key or attribute notation to store and recall values. For example, `st.session_state.my_key`. 

## summary

* dashboards expect to be run more than once
* bare mode lets you test running just once
* when you run slow code, save the output
* each browser tab is a session


# decorators and `@cache_data`

## roadmap

* decorator examples
    * timer 
    * crs for spatial joins
    * `@cache_data`
* revisit toy example from last section
* real-life example


## Timing pandas data processing

```{python}
import pandas as pd, time

def timer(func):
    """Decorator that prints runtime."""
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end = time.time()
        print(f"{func.__name__} took {end - start:.3f} s")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timer
def summarize(df):
    return df.groupby("city")["value"].mean()

df = pd.DataFrame({"city": ["SF","NYC","LA","Chicago"]*3, "value": range(12)})
summary = summarize(df)
summary
```

<!-- MS to GGG: we should mention live that decorators are not a dashboard-only tool! As demonstrated by this slide's example and the next slide. And that we can write our own decorators, or use ones that come with a package (st.cache_data is the latter).-->

## Ensure CRS for GeoPandas joins

```{python}
#| eval: false
import geopandas as gpd

def ensure_crs(crs):
    """Ensure GeoDataFrames use the same CRS."""
    def decorator(func): #unlike prior example, this decorator takes an arg
        def wrapper(gdf1, gdf2, *args, **kwargs):
            if gdf1.crs != crs:
                gdf1 = gdf1.to_crs(crs)
            if gdf2.crs != crs:
                gdf2 = gdf2.to_crs(crs)
            return func(gdf1, gdf2, *args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator

@ensure_crs("EPSG:4326") #center at 0 lat 0 lon
def spatial_join(gdf1, gdf2):
    return gpd.sjoin(gdf1, gdf2, how="inner")
```



## Automate toy example via cache-ing
```{python}
#| eval: false
@st.cache_data
def long_running_function(param1, param2):
    return …
```

1. When user first calls `long_running_function(p1, p2)` for the first time, `@st.cache_data` makes a note of `p1, p2`. It stores the return value in a cache.
2. If the next call is `long_running_function(q1, q2)`, it also stores this in the cache.
3. (time-saving) If the next call is `long_running_function(p1, p2)`, instead of running any code, it just returns the saved value from the cache.

## cache data in streamlit

{{< include snippet/session_state_cache.qmd >}}

[http://uchicago-harris-dap-dashboards-6.streamlit.app/](http://uchicago-harris-dap-dashboards-6.streamlit.app/)

## Revisit a real example: `4/uber_pickups.py`

We have decorated `@st.cache_data` for four different functions

1. `load_data()` 
2. `filterdata(data, hour_selected)`
3. `mpoint()`
4. `histdata()`


## Summary: What all decorators have in common {style="font-size: 0.8em"}

* All wrap a function with extra behavior. 
* They take a function as input and return a modified version.
* Create them when you know you will use an **already-written** function more than once
* Syntax: `@decorator` above a function definition.
* Examples
    * Timing and logging (`@timer`)
	* Validation or transformation (`@ensure_crs(crs)`)
	* Caching (`@st.cache_data`)

# Streamlit and other types of dashboards {style="font-size: 0.8em"}

## Roadmap

* Tips for streamlit
* Tips for final project
* Streamlit vs other dashboarding software
* Promise and pitfalls of dashboards revisited

## Streamlit Tips 
* Lay out your editor and browser windows side by side, so the code and the app can be seen at the same time.
* Your main script should live in a directory other than the root directory.
* [https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/quick-reference/cheat-sheet](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/quick-reference/cheat-sheet)

## Other Streamlit applications we will not cover (examples on the streamlit website)
* Chat box / LLM wrapper
* Draw on external data (user uploaded, from a live database, etc.)

## How should you use streamlit for the final project (and in life)? 
* Build a dashboard when a static figure or table will not suffice
* This occurs when there is too much information to fit on a single figure or table (e.g. one dashboard is better than ten figures)
* The goal, however, is not to proliferate information (e.g. "how can I imagine ten figures so that then I can shoehorn them into dashboard?"). 
* Instead, it is to develop a set of information that a reader or decision-maker would want to interact with.

## Streamlit and other dashboarding tools {style="font-size: 0.8em"}

Streamlit is not in the top 10 of most commonly-used dashboards.

What software might you see elsewhere? Microsoft Power BI, tableau, Qlik, Looker, SAP, plotly, shiny

What dashboard should you use? This is not an important choice. Use whatever your organization or collaborators are already using. Or prototype in streamlit and then port.

What if a job you apply for requires a specific dashboarding software? Spend a few hours teaching it to yourself and then put it on your resume (do **not** just put it on your resume). Or put dashbaords in general and learn the skill for the interview.

## The most famous dashboard ever  {style="font-size: 0.8em"}
New York City Police Department's "CompStat" in the 1990's. Why is it such a perfect application of a dashboard? (Source: *Classic book: Bob Behn's The PerformanceStat Potential*)

<!-- MS to GGG: add link/illustrative screenshot? -->

<!-- note to self: I skipped 4 and 7 since I didn't think they make a lot of sense-->
1. Metrics (arrests, crime rate) are clearly aligned with institutional goals
2. Data are automatically collected daily
3. Historical baseline data are available
4. Focused efforts can produce immediate results
5. All police commanders start as beat cops
6. Multiple subunits facilitate comparison
7. Size plus managerial discretion creates personnel flexibility

Very few other parts of government can meet all seven of these criteria

## Skeptic

Even under these perfect conditions, the dashboard was not very successful. In a survey of 1800 retired NYC police officers of the question “are you confident that major crimes have declined by 80% in New York since 1990s?” more than half said no (Eterno, Verma, and Silverman 2014). Respondents also talked about pressure to change reports to make crime look better.

The key idea is that "what gets measured gets managed". Once a manger focuses on a metric, that metric becomes less useful or informative than it was before.


## Conclusion of section

* Streamlit is an amazing tool
* The key skill, however, is not streamlit, it is organizing information for an external analyst or decision-maker.
* Dashboards have real downsides
* In spite of these downsides, dashboards continue to grow in popularity


## Do-pair-share stub

`$ streamlit run world_map.py`

Plot agricultural production on a map of the world
Will ask students to set up a slider to choose the year

## Backup: Altair troubleshooting 

* It is possible to have Altair installed (as captured by `pip show altair`) but also have `import altair` fail on mac with a chip architecture error: `have 'x86_64', need 'arm64e' or 'arm64')`
* Didn't work: make a new `venv` or update Python. 
* Worked: `pip install --force-reinstall --no-cache-dir --only-binary=:all: rpds-py`

## Backup: Altair troubleshooting

“This is a compatibility issue between the package's [altair’s] generated schema and Python 3.14.” 

Solution: downgrade to Python 3.12.


## Backup: Streamlit troubleshooting 
Make sure that your virtual environment is active!

urllib.error.URLError: <urlopen error [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate (_ssl.c:1000)>

Solution Find your Python’s “Install Certificates.command” in Finder:
1. Open /Applications.
2. Enter the folder for your Python (for example Python 3.11).
3. Double-click Install Certificates.command.

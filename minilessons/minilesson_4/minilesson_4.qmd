# What you will learn today:

- What a pseudocode is
- What a pseucode is useful for
- Best Practices for Pseudocodes
- Test how to write a pseudocode (do-pair-share exercise after minilesson)

If you want to explore more, you can read this course [here](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~hkhosrav/py/slides/02.Pseudocode.pdf).

::: {.notes}
- I will remind them that the materials is very useful for the upcoming problem set (PS4), especially for one of the questions.
- I will also ask them at the beginning if anyone can let me know what a pseudocode is.
- The do-pair-share is optional. So if they want to leave after, they can.

# What is a pseudocode?

---

### What a pseudocode is (1)

A pseudocode is :

- A **step-by-step** ***text*** outline of an algorithm/code that you can later translate into running codes.

- It combines **human language** (most of the time *English*) and **programming language**. 

- A **reader** can quickly understand the main structure and ideas of your code.

In summary, it's a simplified combination of English and code outlines for an algorithm

---

### What a pseudocode is (2)

- **Step-by-step**: It reflects the syntax of the actual algorithm/code
- **Text**: It's not a *Flowchart* (another way to outline an algorithm/code)
- **Human language**: Our concern is more about readability than technical specificities
- **Programming language**: It also includes some programming syntax and statements
- **Readers**: Even someone unfamiliar with your programminig language can understand it.

### What a pseudocode is NOT

- It's *NOT* a full English description of your code
- It's *NOT* runnable codes
- It's *NOT* tied to a specific programming language
- It's *NOT* a graphical representation (diagram or chart)
- It *DOES NOT* replace your algorithm

There is *NO* universal rules/standard on how you should write a pseudocode. It is **subjective**.

While it should be clear, there is *NO* guarantee it will not be ambiguous for some people reading it.

::: {.notes}
- Here, I want aslo to emphasize on the fact that even if there is not universal rules for pseudo code, there are best practices that we will see in this minilesson too.
- I also want to point out that even if a pseudocode might not have ambiguity, they should make sure it's clear as much as possible.

### Actual Code VS Pseudocode (1)

Using this dataset, I wrote a function to find the average lab attendance per week, only for 1st and last weeks.

```{python}
#| eval: false
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# This is fake data I created
lab_attendance_data = {
  'lab_week': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8],
    'attendance': [15, 18, 16, 19, 18, 16, 19, 19]
}
lab_attendance = pd.DataFrame(lab_attendance_data)

# This is function we want to create for this example
def avg_firstlast(data):
  fw_attendance = data['attendance'].iloc[0]
  lw_attendance = data['attendance'].iloc[-1]
  avg_attendance = np.mean([fw_attendance, lw_attendance])
  return avg_attendance
```
---

### Actual Code VS Pseudocode (2)

Pseudocode Example 1

Here is one way to write the pseudo code for the function we created earlier:

....

```
FUNCTION avg_firstlast(data):
BEGIN
    fw_attendance <- first value in 'attendance' column in data
    lw_attendance <- last value in 'attendance' column in data
    avg_attendance <- average of fw_attendance & lw_attendance
    RETURN avg_attendance
END
ENDFUNCTION
```

....

This pseudocode is using more description.
---

### Actual Code VS Pseudocode (3)

Pseudocode Example 2

Here is **ANOTHER** way to write the pseudo code for the function we created earlier:

....

```
FUNCTION avg_firstlast(data)
    first_val ← data.attendance[0]
    last_val ← data.attendance[-1]
    avg_attendance ← (first_val + last_val) / 2
    return avg_attendance
END FUNCTION
```

....

This pseudocode uses less English description, using more conventional expressions.

::: {.notes}
- I will go quickly over those 2 examples and explains the main difference between the two of them.

# Why use a pseucode?

---

### Reasons why pseudocode is useful

**If pseudocode is subjective, why even use it in the first place? Here is why:**

- Can help you clarify and structure your thoughts before writing runnable codes
- Describes how your algorithm/code works (explaining the process behing your code)
- Allows someone with no coding background to understand what your code is doing
- Makes reviewing codes easier
- Reduces the number of comments needed in your script 

::: {.notes}
- I will also ask if someone can thinking of another reasons they think a pseudocode may be useful

# What are the pseudocode best practices?

---

### Common conventions for pseudocode (1)

While there is no universal rules on how to write a pseudocode, there are some best practices:

- Use **one line per statement**
  - *A bad example* 
```
FUNCTION avg_firstlast(data)
    first_val ← data.attendance[0] & last_val ← data.attendance[-1]
```

- Use **blocks** to give structure to your pseudocode
  - *Do this*
```
Block_1
  Block_1_1
  Block_1_2
Block_2
  Block_2_1
```
---

### Common conventions for pseudocode (2)

- **Capitalize the first keyword** to indicate the primary functions of each block (like FUNCTION)
- Some keywords like **IF, WHILE, FOR, FUNCTION etc.** are reserved by some conventions
- **Write exactly what you mean**, NOT exactly what you wrote as a code. You are not trying to reproduce your codes
- **Describe everything** that is happening in your code (DO NOT leave out anything)
- Use **standard code structure** as much as possible (For example, use identation for this class)

::: {.notes}
- Remind them again that those are more conventions than universally accepted rules

# Do-pair-share (OPTIONAL)

---

### Exercise to practice writing a pseudocode

**Try to understand the code below and write its pseudocode.**

```{python}
import numpy as np

# Tip 1: First, try to undertand what each line are doing
random_list = [12, 25, 32, 16, 33, 28, 18, 19, 21, 22]
updated_list = []

# Tip 2: Try to write pseudocode for each block
for num in random_list:
    num_half = num / 2
    updated_list.append(num_half)

# Tip 3: I decided to not add comments on purpose
final_list = updated_list[1:-1]

# Tip 4: This is optional. You can do it at home!
avg_list = np.mean(final_list)
```

::: {.notes}
One solution will be available on those slides, but I won't share it if they are doing the exercise.

### Do-pair-share Solutions (1)

**This is ONE pseudocode for the do-pair-share code**

...

```
SET random_list TO [12, 25, 32, 16, 33, 28, 18, 19, 21, 22]
SET updated_list TO empty list

FOR EACH num in random_list DO:
  SET num_half TO num / 2
  APPEND num_half TO updated_list
END FOR

SET final_list TO all elements of updated_list
except the first and last elements

SET avg_list TO the average value of final_list
```
...

---

### Do-pair-share Solutions (2)

**This is ANOTHER pseudocode for the do-pair-share code**

...

```
random_list <- [12, 25, 32, 16, 33, 28, 18, 19, 21, 22]
updated_list <- empty list

FOR EACH num in random_list:
  num_half <- num / 2
  APPEND num_half TO updated_list
END FOR

final_list <- updated_list[1:-1]

avg_list <- average value of final_list
```

## Curve
* The grade cutoffs in syllabus are a floor
* If needed, we will curve so that this year has same letter grade distribution as last year

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import altair as alt
file_path = 'data/2024-12-16letter_grades.csv'
grades_df = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Remove null values for letter_grade
grades_df = grades_df.dropna(subset=['letter_grade'])

# Collapse the dataset to calculate the share of each letter grade
grade_shares = grades_df['letter_grade'].value_counts(normalize=True).reset_index()
grade_shares.columns = ['letter_grade', 'Share']

# Create an Altair bar chart for the histogram of letter grade share distribution
chart = alt.Chart(grade_shares).mark_bar().encode(
    x=alt.X('letter_grade:N', title='Letter Grade', sort='-y'),
    y=alt.Y('Share:Q', title='Share')
).properties(
    title='Distribution of Letter Grade Shares (Fall 2024)',
    width=300,
    height=300
)
# Display the chart
chart.show()
```


## Lab assessment feedback
* Problem: Students (and TAs) are reporting that feedback format in Canvas is sub-optimal. 
    * Solution: We are working on alternatives like incorporating Gradescope to improve the quality of feedback
* Problem: Canvas is laggy 
    * Solution: close all apps before starting the lockdown browser

## PS2 impressions
* Mostly excellent
* Copy-pasting ChatGPT output is low value
    * Real world: your manager also has ChatGPT. She doesn't need your help to query it.
    * 30538: you won't have ChatGPT on exams

## PS2 tips
- Graphing if you wrote code to display graph but it didn't render in PDF, that is considered "complete"
    * We've collected and updated possible solutions [here](https://github.com/uchicago-harris-dap/student30538-w26/wiki/Solution---Wrapping-Code-Output-and-Knitting-to-PDF)
    * Shoutout: Jianghan Yuan for [clever solution](https://edstem.org/us/courses/89578/discussion/7562096) 
    * If the solutions don't work for you, please come to OH or post on [Ed thread](https://edstem.org/us/courses/89578/discussion/7516928)
* Don't push `parking_tickets_one_percent.csv`. Instead, update your `.gitignore` in pset submission

## PS2 grading
* Only 50\% or 100\%
* Method
    * AI takes a first pass, tells us if incomplete, which questions look incomplete. 
    * Human takes a second pass at psets flagged by AI as incomplete
* Can always request a regrade if you think we got it wrong

## Midcourse survey  
* Harris survey - sent out last week, due tonight
* Our own survey - released today on canvas, *complete in lab*, closes tonight
* Both anonymous!
* Kids and I will bake something for the section with the highest participation!

## Feedback already received
* Where we are in the course (review [syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NCOS61C5babMWy0JaMvSn89iKRVBYATyD_UoKRz3ljk/edit?tab=t.0))
* Grading has been slow, working hard to speed it up behind the scenes
* Upload/printing process (normal week)
    * Monday/Wednesday before class: push PDF and print
    * After: fix typos or things that are unclear

## Logistics and misc
* I will be running a conference this Thursday. Professor Shi will teach that lecture.
* There were a few MUD cards about Altair's transform syntax that I haven't had the chance to write slides on yet.  Tracking this.
